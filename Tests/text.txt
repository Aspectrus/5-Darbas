hey are not considered a threat to food safety, but do cause production losses.

Officials say they plan to kill all cows on any farms where the bacteria are found, even if some of the animals are healthy.

They say many of the cows will be slaughtered at processing plants and used for beef, but some cows will have to be killed and buried on the farms or dumped in approved landfills. Officials have the legal authority to forcibly enter farms and kill animals even in cases where a farmer might resist.

Workers in the rural sector have expressed concern about the welfare of farmers if it comes to this, saying the cull may trigger suicides among owners of infected cattle, according to Radio NZ.

One man who spoke to the station said he feared for the mental health of people with those herds.

?What about the emotional harm it?s doing to the people who run the cattle,? he said.

?That?s immeasurable ? there?s no money value you can put on that. It?s driving people nuts.

?When they come out with the next lot of suicide figures in 12 months time and find that they?ve escalated, I wonder if anyone?s going to have enough brains to say ?we caused some of this?.?
